Project Description:
------------------------------------------------------------
This project is a Python-based utility designed to recover access to protected Excel (.xlsx) files
by intelligently brute-forcing the password and creating an identical, unprotected copy of the original file.
It preserves all contents and structure, providing the user with a usable version of the document when the password is forgotten or lost.


Key Features:
- Automated password cracking for Excel files
- Creation of decrypted copies with full data retention
- Console output with progress updates
- Easy-to-use and configurable codebase
